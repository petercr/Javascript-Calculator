## This is one of the four final projects for the Front End Certification 
It is the first of four projects to complete the Front End Developer Certificate at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

### Project Guidelines 

 Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/).
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

*User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
*User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
*User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
